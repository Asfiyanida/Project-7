# Project-7

Objective: 

Trade&Ahead is a financial consultancy firm who provide their customers with personalized investment strategies. They have hired you as a Data Scientist and provided you with data comprising stock price and some financial indicators for a few companies listed under the New York Stock Exchange. They have assigned you the tasks of analyzing the data, grouping the stocks based on the attributes provided, and sharing insights about the characteristics of each group.

Business Insights & Recommendations:
1. Trade&Ahead should look into more financial (fundamental and technical) indicators to make better predictions of stock price movements and assessment of company valuation.
2. They should also conduct cluster analysis separately for each of the economic sectors as it will help them to provide better investment recommendations to their clients.
